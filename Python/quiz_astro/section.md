A. A 3 million solar mass black hole.
B. A giant star cluster

B.4 kpc from the center of the Milky Way in the halo.
C. 8 kpc from the center of the Milky Way in the disk.
D. 20 kpc from the center of the Milky Way in the disk.
Explanation : Our solar system is situated about 8 kiloparsecs (kpc), or approximately 27,000 light
years, from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. It resides within the galactic disk, specifically on
the inner edge of the Orion Arm.
12-  What is the significance of the « Great Wall » structure revealed in redshift surveys ?
A. It is the largest known galaxy.
B. It is a \~100 Mpc strucutre that indicates the scale of large cosmic structures.
C. It is a void in distribution of galaxies.
D. It represents the edge of the observable universe.
Explanation : The "Great Wall" is a vast conglomeration of galaxies spanning over 500 million
light-years (about 150 megaparsecs), discovered through redshift surveys. Its existence
demonstrates the immense scale of large-scale cosmic structures in the universe.
13- How does the peculiar velocity field relate to the mass density field in the unverse ?
A. It is independent of the mass density field.
B. It is generated by the mass density field and reflects the underlying mass concentrations.
C. It only affects small-scale structures.
D. It is only relevant for dark matter.
Explanation : On large scales, the peculiar velocity field is coherent with the underlying mass
density field. This means that peculiar velocities (deviations from the uniform cosmic expansion)
are generated by mass concentrations and can be used to infer and study the distribution of matter in
the universe.
14- What is the purpose of redshift surveys in cosmology ?
A. To measure the temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation.
B. To map the 3-D distribution of galaxies in space.
C. To determine the age of the universe.
D. To study the chemical composition of stars.
Explanation : Redshift surveys measure the redshifts of galaxies to determine their distances and
positions, allowing astronomers to map the three-dimensional structure of the universe. These maps
reveal how galaxies are distributed and help in studying the large-scale structure of the cosmos


 Part2:                                                                                                                                                           1-  Most compact jets are one-sided:
Because the jets are strongly beamed, and one side is pointing closer to us
Explanation: Most compact jets appear one-sided due to relativistic  beaming, where
the side pointing towards us is amplified in brightness because of its high speed
2- The origin of the intra-cluster gas in clusters of galaxies:
It is material ejected or stripped out of galaxies long after the formation of the cluster
Expt\*: the intra cluster gas primarily originates from materials that has been ejected or
stripped from galaxies over time due to gravitational interactions within cluster.
3- The cosmological principal is:
The universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales
Expt\*: isotropic mean the same in all directions and homogenious means the same
everywhere, it is not necessarly on small scales
4-  At what redshift do galaxies more biased tracers of mass?
At z=2
Explt\*: halo bias increases with redshift.  Massive halos are rarer at high redshift.
These rare peaks have a higher clustering bias.
5- What sort of galaxy environments is our own milky way?
Asmall group of *30 galaxies
Expt*: the milky way is part of the local group, which consists of about 30 galaxies,
including Andromeda Galaxy and several smaller galaxies
6- As photons travels through our expanding Universe over millions Universe (or billions
) of years, what happens to them?
Their wavelength increases
Ept\*: As the universe expands, photons experience redshift, meaning their wavelength
increases and their energy decreases.
7- Some extragalactic jets have components that appears to move faster than light
(superluminal motion). This happens because:
It is an illusion because the jets are pointed as us and moving close to the speed of light.
Ept\*: Superluminal motion is an optical illusion created when the jet is moving at
relativistic speeds nearly parallel to the line of sight, making the components appear to
exceed the speed of light.
8- What sort of environment do you often find cD galaxies in but very rarely find any
spiral galaxies in?
In the center of very rich clusters, but you very rarely find spiral galaxies in those same
environments.
9- What sources dominate the sky at radio wavelengths?
Active Galaxies
Expt\*: Active Galaxies, particularly those with active galactic nuclei, dominate the sky at
radio wavelengths, emitting significant radio waves due to the processes occurring
around supermassive black holes.
10- What is the most efficient energy source in the Universe?
Accretion onto a black hole
Explt\*: Accretion onto a black hole is considered the most efficient energy source in the
Universe, as it can convert a large amount of mass into energy according to E=m(c)^2
11- What does the bias factor (b) indicate in the context of galaxy clustering?
describes how light (galaxies) traces mass (dark matter) in the Universe.
12- Which of the following statements about galaxy clusters is true?
DM constitutes about 8%-85% O of the mass in clusters
13- What is the significance of the Surveys-Zel’dovich effect in studying galaxy clusters?
It provides a mass-weighted measure of hot gas clusters
